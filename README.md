# arvato_capstone
The script with the analysis done for the capstone project in the framework of Udacity Data Scientis Nanodegree

## Goals of the project

The project included three main challenges:

- Using the data of Arvato and data with demographics on the German population and employing the methods of unsupervised learning, I needed to identify the segments of Arvato customersâ€™ database and describe which parts of the German population are well represented in the Aravato dataset and which parts are underrepresented.
- I needed to make a classification model that would predict which customers would respond to the mailout campaign launched by Arvato.
- Finally, I was expected to submit my predictions to the Kaggle and compete with other students of Udacity.
